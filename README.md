# statswebapp API
This is the backend for my statistics web application (see [here](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/statswebapp-ui) for the frontend).

It's my first time using C# for an API so there will be some growing pains.

# Building/Running
I'm using the `dotnet` command line to build and run my API. It's as simple as `dotnet run` which will build the application automatically.
